# pwd
Simple browser-based password manager with local backup import/export.

Created as a part of a one-person project for the course IT2805 Web Technologies at NTNU. The use of external code or web frameworks was restricted for this, so it's mostly made using plain JS and semi-new things such as the Web Crypto API.
